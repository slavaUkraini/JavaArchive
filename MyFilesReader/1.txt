meansea level msl is a datum representing the average height of the oceans surface such as the halfway point between the mean high tide and the mean low tide used as a standard in reckoning land elevation msl also plays an important role in marine navigation as a chart datum and aviation where standard sea level pressure is used as the measurement datum of altitude at flight levels detection of longterm variations of mean sea level requires careful measurement but can provide information on climate change over geologic time sea levels have changed dramatically contents hide measurement height above mean sea level difficulties in utilization sea level and dry land sea level change local and eustatic sea level short term and periodic changes long term changes glaciers and ice caps geological influences changes through geologic time recent changes aviation flight level see also references external links
